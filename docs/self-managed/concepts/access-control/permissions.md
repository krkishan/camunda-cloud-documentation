Permissions allow you to control the level of access a user has to a particular component. Traditionally, this is often described as being able to provide users with "read" or "write" access.

Permissions are assigned to [APIs](self-managed/concepts/access-control/apis.md) and can be grouped to form
[roles](/self-managed/concepts/access-control/roles.md).

:::note
Refer to the [components documentation](../../../components/overview.md) to see what permissions are supported or required.
