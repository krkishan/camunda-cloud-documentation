An API refers to a service that provides resources, and it is through these resources that we are able to control
access via permissions.

In [Identity](/self-managed/identity/what-is-identity.md) we use APIs to attach 
[Permissions](/self-managed/concepts/access-control/permissions.md) to and once they have been created the
components in the Camunda Cloud stack are then able to allow or deny Users certain functionality.
