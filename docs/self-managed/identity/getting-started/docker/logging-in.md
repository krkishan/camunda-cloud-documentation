In this part of the tutorial, we'll show you how to access the login page and log in to the Identity application.

### Accessing the UI

Navigate to `localhost:8080` to see the UI exposed by the Identity component.

### Default user

The configuration in this guide creates an example user during installation; use this account to log in.

```text
Username: demo
Password: demo
```

:::note Want to create more users?
Creating a user in Identity is not currently supported. To create a user see
[Keycloak - creating a user](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#proc-creating-user_server_administration_guide)
for advice.

### Home screen

You are directed to the home page once logged in successfully.
