To create a permission using Identity, take the following steps:

1. Log in to the Identity UI and navigate to the **API** tab:

2. Click on the API that you would like to create a permission for. This will open the details page.

3. Click on the **Permissions** tab beneath the API name.

4. Click the **Add Permission** button located on the top right of the table and a modal will open:

5. We are now able to fill out the details of the permission. For this guide, we will use a set of example values. When you have inserted the details, click **Add**:

:::note Not sure what permissions to add?
Each component within the cloud stack has support for specific permissions. We recommend checking the [documentation for the required component](../../../components/overview.md) to find out the list of permissions it supports.

On confirmation, the modal will close, the table will update, and your new permission will be shown:
