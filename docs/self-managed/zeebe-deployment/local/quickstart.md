This quickstart guide introduces you to the main concepts of Zeebe in five steps without the need to write a single line of code.

## Step 1: Download the Zeebe distribution

You can download the latest distribution from the [Zeebe release page](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/releases).

Extract the archive and enter the Zeebe directory.

```
tar -xzvf zeebe-distribution-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
cd zeebe-broker-X.Y.Z/
```

:::note
Some command examples might not work on Windows if you use cmd or
Powershell. For Windows users, we recommend using a bash-like shell, i.e. Git
Bash, Cygwin, or MinGW for this guide.
:::

Inside the Zeebe directory, you'll find multiple directories:

```
tree -d
```

```
.
├── bin     - Binaries and start scripts of the distribution
├── conf    - Zeebe and logging configuration
└── lib     - Shared java libraries
```

## Step 2: Start the Zeebe broker

To start a Zeebe broker, use the `broker` or `broker.bat` file located in the
`bin/` folder.

```
./bin/broker
```

```
23:39:13.246 [] [main] INFO  io.camunda.zeebe.broker.system - Scheduler configuration: Threads{cpu-bound: 2, io-bound: 2}.
23:39:13.270 [] [main] INFO  io.camunda.zeebe.broker.system - Version: X.Y.Z
23:39:13.273 [] [main] INFO  io.camunda.zeebe.broker.system - Starting broker with configuration {
```

You will see some output which contains the version of the broker and
configuration parameters like directory locations and API socket addresses.

To continue this guide, open another terminal to execute commands using the
Zeebe CLI `zbctl`.

We can now check the status of the Zeebe broker.

:::note
By default, the embedded gateway listens to a plaintext connection, but the clients are configured to use TLS. Therefore, all `zbctl` commands in the quickstart will specify the `--insecure` flag.
:::

```
./bin/zbctl --insecure status
```

```
Cluster size: 1
Partitions count: 1
Replication factor: 1
Brokers:
  Broker 0 - 0.0.0.0:26501
    Partition 1 : Leader
```

## Step 3: Deploy a process

A [process](/components/concepts/processes.md) is used to orchestrate loosely coupled job
workers and the flow of data between them.

In this guide, we'll use an example process `order-process.bpmn`. You can
download it with the following link:
[order-process.bpmn](assets/order-process.bpmn).

![order-process](assets/order-process.png)

The process describes a sequential flow of three tasks **Collect Money**, **Fetch Items**, and **Ship Parcel**. If you open the `order-process.bpmn` file in a text editor, you'll see every task has an attribute `type` defined in the XML which is later used as job type.

```
<!-- [...] -->
<bpmn:serviceTask id="collect-money" name="Collect Money">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <zeebe:taskDefinition type="payment-service" />
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
<!-- [...] -->
<bpmn:serviceTask id="fetch-items" name="Fetch Items">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <zeebe:taskDefinition type="inventory-service" />
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
<!-- [...] -->
<bpmn:serviceTask id="ship-parcel" name="Ship Parcel">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <zeebe:taskDefinition type="shipment-service" />
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
<!-- [...] -->
```

To complete an instance of this process, we need to activate and complete one job for each of
the types `payment-service`, `inventory-service`, and `shipment-service`.

First, let's deploy the process to the Zeebe broker.

```
./bin/zbctl --insecure deploy resource order-process.bpmn
```

```
{
  "key": 2251799813685250,
  "processes": [
    {
      "bpmnProcessId": "order-process",
      "version": 1,
      "processKey": 2251799813685249,
      "resourceName": "order-process.bpmn"
    }
  ]
}
```

See a few concepts important to understand at this point below:

- A **job** is simply a work item in a process that must be completed before a process instance can proceed to the next step. ([See: Job Workers](/components/concepts/job-workers.md))
- A **process instance** is one running instance of a process model. In our case, this is an individual order to be fulfilled. ([See: Processes](/components/concepts/processes.md))

If a job is available for a given process instance, the worker activates it, completes it, and notifies Zeebe. Zeebe then advances that process instance to the next step in the process.

## Step 4: Create a process instance

After the process is deployed, we can create a new instance of it. Every
instance of a process is a single execution of the process. To create a new
instance, we must specify the process ID from the BPMN file. In
our case, the ID is `order-process` as defined in the `order-process.bpmn`:

```
<bpmn:process id="order-process" isExecutable="true">
```

Every instance of a process normally processes some kind of data. We can
specify the initial data of the instance as variables when we start the instance.

:::note
Windows users who want to execute this command using cmd or Powershell
have to escape the variables differently.

- cmd: `"{\"orderId\": 1234}"`
- Powershell: `'{"\"orderId"\": 1234}'`

:::

```
./bin/zbctl --insecure create instance order-process --variables '{"orderId": 1234}'
```

```
{
  "processKey": 2251799813685249,
  "bpmnProcessId": "order-process",
  "version": 1,
  "processInstanceKey": 2251799813685251
}
```

## Step 5: Complete a process instance

To complete the instance, all three tasks must be executed. In Zeebe, a job is
created for every task which is reached during process instance execution. To finish a job and thereby the corresponding task, must be activated
and completed by a [job worker](/components/concepts/job-workers.md).

A job worker is a long-living process which repeatedly tries to activate jobs for a given job type and completes them after executing its business logic. The `zbctl` also provides a command to spawn simple job workers using an external command or
script.

The job worker receives for every job the process instance variables as JSON object on
`stdin` and has to return its result also as a JSON object on `stdout` if it
handled the job successfully.

In this example, we use the Unix command `cat`, which outputs what it receives
on `stdin`. To complete a process instance we now must create a job worker for
each of the three task types from the process definition: `payment-service`,
`inventory-service`, and `shipment-service`.

:::note
For Windows users, this command does not work with cmd as the `cat` command does not exist. We recommend using Powershell or a bash-like shell to execute this command.
:::

```
./bin/zbctl --insecure create worker payment-service --handler cat &
./bin/zbctl --insecure create worker inventory-service --handler cat &
./bin/zbctl --insecure create worker shipment-service --handler cat &
```

```
2019/06/06 20:54:36 Handler completed job 2251799813685257 with variables
{"orderId":1234}
2019/06/06 20:54:36 Activated job 2251799813685264 with variables
{"orderId":1234}
2019/06/06 20:54:36 Handler completed job 2251799813685264 with variables
{"orderId":1234}
2019/06/06 20:54:36 Activated job 2251799813685271 with variables
{"orderId":1234}
2019/06/06 20:54:36 Handler completed job 2251799813685271 with variables
{"orderId":1234}
```

After the job workers are running in the background, we can create more instances
of our process to observe how the workers will complete them.

```
./bin/zbctl --insecure create instance order-process --variables '{"orderId": 12345}'
```

To close all job workers, use the `kill` command to stop the background processes.

```
kill %1 %2 %3
```

To visualize the state of the process instances, start the
[Zeebe simple monitor](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-simple-monitor), a community maintained project.
