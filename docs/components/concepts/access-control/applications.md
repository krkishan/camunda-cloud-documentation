To be able to use [Identity](/self-managed/identity/what-is-identity.md) for authentication
each deployed component requires a matching Application to be created.

When an application is created in the Identity UI, a Client ID and Client Secret will be generated which can be
used in the component configuration allowing authentication flows to happen.
