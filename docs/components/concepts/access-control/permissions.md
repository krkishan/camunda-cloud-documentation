Permissions are a way for you to control the level of access a User has to a particular component. Traditionally
this is often described as being able to provide users with "read" or "write" access.

Permissions are assigned to [APIs](./apis.md) and can be grouped to form
[Roles](./roles.md).
:::note
Please refer to the individual component's documentation to see what permissions are supported or required.
